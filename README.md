# Writing Project

## Vision

An educational web-based visual novel that teaches 8th-grade curriculum through an engaging fantasy narrative.

### Tagline

**"A story where everyone can get involved."**

## Core Philosophy

**"I JUST WANT TO BE LIKE HEY THIS IS KINDA COOL IF USED IN THIS MANNER"**

This project demonstrates responsible LLM usage in gaming:
- Heavily constrained AI interactions with "railings"
- Educational priority over entertainment
- Privacy-first, accessible design
- Low-impact for old devices and poor connections

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts difficulty, reading level, and pacing to individual players
- **Multiple Progression Paths**: Golden (guided), Red (conflict), White (cooperation) strings of fate
- **Experience System**: Mental, Physical, and Emotional development tracks
- **Karma System**: Empathize, Relate, or Coerce approaches with equal rewards but different consequences
- **Grade-Based Unlocks**: A students get extra content, S students get secret achievements
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Skippable content for sensitive topics without penalty
- **Multiplayer Fabric**: Asynchronous cameos of other players' characters

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, minimal CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Go server (lightweight)
- **Database**: SQLite for analytics
- **LLM**: Strategic, constrained usage for personalization
- **Hosting**: Web-based, progressive web app (PWA)

## Documentation

- **[CONCEPTS.md](docs/CONCEPTS.md)** - Core design philosophies and metaphysical systems
- **[GAME_FEATURES.md](docs/GAME_FEATURES.md)** - Player-facing features and mechanics
- **[docs/raw/](docs/raw/)** - Complete conversation transcripts

## Development Priorities

1. **Safety**: No illicit content to minors
2. **Legal Compliance**: US domestic security laws
3. **Privacy**: Anonymized data, user deletion rights
4. **Quality**: Fantastic player experience
