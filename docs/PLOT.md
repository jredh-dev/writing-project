# Plot & Narrative - Writing Project

## World Setting

### The Nation of a Thousand Cities (NofATC / NTC / 1000c)

**Geography:**
- Located on "B Margaera" (the thousand-city continent)
- Opposite continent: "A Margera" 
- "Margaera" means continent in ancient language

**Political Structure:**
- 1000 cities, each with a Mage's Tower at its center
- Each tower houses a Mage who controls that city
- The Mage IS the government
- Can make their people rich or poor
- Independent city-states under loose confederation

**Unifying Force:**
- **The Airfleet of a Thousand Cities**
- Only shared national institution
- Controls sky above the continent
- Controls sky above the sea
- Military/trade coordination

**Technology Level:**
- Industrial Revolution era
- Trains and skyscrapers

---

## The School

### Wincon Studiary

**Type:** Magic high school / technical college
**Location:** One of the thousand cities (walking distance from student housing)
**Student Age:** High school entry age (14-15 years old)

**Curriculum:**
- Magic instruction
- Real-world subjects (math, physics, philosophy, etc.)
- Practical spellcasting classes

**Key Rule:**
- All students issued a wand
- Must keep wand holstered except during Practical classes
- **ABSOLUTE RULE:** Point wand at anyone → Instant expulsion → Game Over
- No exceptions, no second chances

---

## Educational Philosophy

### Real Knowledge in Fantasy Context

**Subjects Taught:**
- Mathematics (real math)
- Physics (real physics)  
- Philosophy (real philosophy)
- History (real concepts)
- Chemistry
- Magic (fantasy overlay)

**Integration Method:**
- Teach real concepts through spells and stories
- Philosophy: Same ideas, different philosophers
- **Running Joke:** In all universes, same people make same realizations
  - Names are the same
  - Gender is swapped
  - Key difference: No one listens to women (parallel to real world)
  - Example: A female Descartes makes "I think therefore I am" but is dismissed

## The Gods

### Nature of Divinity

**Not True Gods:** Religious and spiritual ideals replaced by really powerful humans

**Current State:** Growing febrile (feverish, unstable, weakening)

**Implication:** The age of gods is ending, power is shifting

### Witness - God of Words, Pages, and Secrets Shared

**Domain:**
- Words and language
- Written knowledge (pages)
- Shared secrets and stories

**The Player Character:**
- Fragment/shard of Witness
- Demigod status (unknown to them)
- Inherits Witness's power in specific way

---

## Player Character

### Identity

**Name:** Customizable
- Game periodically asks: "Is that your real name?"
- If player changes it: NPC teases them, story rewrites dynamically
- Creates running gag about identity

**Age:** 14-15 (entering high school)

**Background:**
- **Parents:** Were mages, died in tragic accident
- **Guardian:** Relative who set them up with apartment
- **Living Situation:** Own apartment, walking distance from school
- **School Choice:** Nearest magic school guardian could find (technical college-level institution)

### Divine Nature (Hidden)

**True Identity:** Fragment of Witness (God of Words, Pages, Secrets Shared)

**When They Learn:** Not in prologue, later reveal

**Divine Power - The Superpower:**
- **They literally cannot die**
- Can restart over and over again
- This IS the core mechanic
- Deaths are canonical (they remember)
- "Divine motive" (soul's calling) tugs on rules of life

**Divine Motive Manifestations:**
- Random cool things happen related to what they like
- Appears as luck or "fantasy logic"
- Actually their soul reshaping reality subtly
- They don't realize it's them doing it

**Divine Prophecy/Purpose:**
- Witness great events and tragedies
- Participate if they dare
- No prescribed destiny beyond observation

---

## Core Conflict

### The End of the World

**As Perceived by Teenage Mind:**

A vision/dream/encounter with a girl:
- Beautiful, most beautiful girl you've ever seen
- Skin color shifts: green, brown, blue (constantly changing)
- **For straight girls:** She becomes your best friend
- **For straight boys & lesbians:** You fall in love (misconception of relationship)

**The Girl IS The Earth:**
1. She gets zits (environmental problems)
2. Her face gets red (fever, climate crisis)
3. She tries to hide from you (shame, withdrawal)
4. You say it's okay (comfort, acceptance)
5. You try to stop her from leaving (desperation)
6. You touch her (connection)
7. You turn red (shared condition)
8. You explode and go "pop" (death, rebirth, cycle)

**Metaphor:** Climate crisis, end of world, but personalized and intimate

## Story Structure

### Development Phases

**Current Focus:** Prologue only
- Will be its own `cmd` in the project
- Code will be frozen after completion (only bug fixes)
- Written in Go
- Self-contained experience

**Future:** Additional chapters (not designed yet)

---

## Prologue Structure

### Chapter Outline

**Setting:** Player is asleep, dreaming

#### Section 1: Dream Sequence - Magic and Gods
- Everything is open response
- Responses are recorded and incorporated into story later
- No judgment, just data collection
- Sets up player's relationship with fantasy concepts

#### Section 2: Registration Day
- Player shows up to register for school
- Summer classes are ongoing (school is active)
- Tours the campus
- Meets someone important
- Learns about the teachers

#### Section 3: Teacher Selection (First Choice)
- Introduced to two teachers
- **Open Response Question:** "Which teacher do you want to get assigned to, and why?"
- Player explains their choice
- **Consequence:** They are assigned the teacher they DON'T like
- **Hidden Mechanic:** When they shake YOUR hand, you get some kind of sickness
- **This sickness turns YOU into a POV character later on**

#### Section 4: Tutorial Mechanics (in order)
1. **Multiple Choice** - Standard selection
2. **Many Choice** - Select multiple options
3. **Numeric Response** - Enter numbers
4. **Open Response** - Type complete sentences
5. **Consequences** - See results of choices

### Ending
- **Single ending** for prologue (no variations yet)
- Sets up chapter 1
- Progression based on grades

---

## Progression System (Prologue)

### What Matters for Progression:
- **Grades** - Must achieve minimum grade to continue
- No hidden attributes tracked yet
- Neutral karma across the board
- No friendships/enmities established

### Grading:
- Based on tutorial question performance
- F = fail, must retry
- C or higher = pass and continue

---

## Key NPCs (Prologue Only)

### Teacher(s)
- Two teachers introduced
- Player must choose between them
- Gets assigned the one they don't want

### Classmate
- Someone important met during tour
- Role TBD in future chapters

### Guardian
- Mentioned in backstory
- Set up player's apartment
- Found nearest magic school
- Not present in prologue

---

## Key Themes & Lessons (Prologue)

### Educational Goals:
1. **How to play** - Teach all interaction types
2. **Consequences matter** - Choices have results
3. **Trust the process** - Sometimes you don't get what you want
4. **Observation** - Important details are everywhere

### Emotional Beats:
- Loss (dead parents, but not dwelled on)
- Independence (own apartment, new school)
- Anticipation (magic school excitement)
- Subversion (don't get chosen teacher)
- Mystery (the sickness, the important person)

---

## Mana System (Not in Prologue)

**Note:** Mana is introduced in Chapter 1, not prologue.

### Introduction Event: Enrichment Ceremony
- Player drinks their first mana potion
- Causes hallucination
- Unlocks mana system

### Mana Costs:
- Casting spells requires mana
- Specific costs TBD

### The Well Mechanic:
- Someone's well is always negative
- Their mana is the opposite (positive)
- Together they balance

**Deepening The Well:**
- Forcefully add mana → well deepens
- Example: Well at -5, spend 5 mana
- Deterioration timing:
  - 1 hour: -5 → -4
  - 2 hours: -4 → -3  
  - 4 hours: -3 → -2
  - (Exponential decay)
- **Well never goes back to 0**

### Casting Without Mana:
- Player takes damage
- **Lore:** Casting without mana is dangerous
- **Backstory Connection:** This is how their parents died

---

## Parent Backstory

**Key Fact:** Player's parents were mages.

**Death:** Tragic accident (implied: casting without mana, or mana-related disaster)

**Impact on Player:**
- Raised by guardian
- Attending magic school (following in parents' footsteps)
- Danger of mana system is personal

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Prologue-Specific:
- Self-contained Go application
- All tutorial mechanics demonstrated
- Save player responses for later use
- Grade calculation and pass/fail logic
- Single ending (no branching yet)

### Data Collection:
- Dream sequence responses (open-ended)
- Teacher preference reasoning
- All tutorial answers
- Reading speed/comprehension metrics
- Personality indicators

---

## Questions Tabled for Future Chapters

The following questions were asked but deferred until post-prologue development:

**Resource System (Q29-34):**
- Mana costs for different actions
- Starting mana value
- Regeneration rates
- Negative mana behavior
- Damage from casting without mana

**Experience & Leveling (Q35-38):**
- XP thresholds
- XP rewards
- Level caps
- Ability tiers

**Grading Algorithm (Q39-42):**
- Detailed grade calculation
- Partial credit
- Time impact

**And more** - See full question list in planning documents

---

## Prologue Length & Pacing

**Target Duration:** Variable based on player
- Measure attention span
- Measure reading aptitude
- Tailor content amount dynamically
- Fast readers: More content
- Slow readers: Concise content
- Accessible to all speeds

**Design Philosophy:** 
The prologue should feel complete but leave mysteries unsolved. It's an appetizer, not the meal.
