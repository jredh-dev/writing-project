## Autism Score Examples

### Muffin Paper Context

**Quote:** "We're so far gone we forgot what the paper on the muffin was for"

**Situation:** Someone peels the paper off a muffin before eating it

**Interpretation:**
- Missing key context clues (paper prevents mess/sticking)
- Literal thinking vs contextual understanding
- Pattern: Not understanding the "why" behind common practices

**Personality Impact:**
- Raises autism score
- If player RELATES to this (does it themselves): also raises autism score
- If player notices and finds it amusing: no impact
- If player doesn't notice at all: neutral

**Design Note:** Autism score contributes to personality profile, affects dialogue options and NPC interactions. Not a judgment, just a characteristic that shapes the narrative experience.

## The Well (Negative Personality Dimension)

**Concept:** A single negative number in personality tracking

**Properties:**
- Only negative number in personality development system
- Represents something missing or depleted
- Related to context awareness, social cues, neurotypical expectations

**Relationship to Mana:**
```
The Well (negative) + Mana = 0 (balance)
```

**When mana is spent:**
- Time must be spent accruing it again through:
  - Physical activities/exercises
  - Emotional activities/exercises  
  - Mental activities/exercises
- OR shortcut via wealth (cheating/buying/skipping ahead)

**Design Philosophy:**
- The Well represents lack or deficit
- Mana represents capacity or power
- Together they balance to zero (equilibrium)
- Spending mana creates temporary deficit
- Filling The Well restores balance
