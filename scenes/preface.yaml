      You wake with a start. Today is the day - registration at the Wincon Studiary,
      the magic school your guardian found for you. Your apartment is quiet. Too quiet.
      You grab your backpack and head out into the bustling city.

      The Studiary towers above you - a massive skyscraper of steel and glass,
      with strange symbols glowing along its edges. Students mill about,
      wands holstered at their sides. A helpful older student approaches.
      'First day? Need help finding registration?'

      At registration, you're shown profiles of two teachers:

      Professor Aldwin: Strict, traditional, teaches by-the-book magic theory.
      Professor Sera: Creative, experimental, encourages improvisation and discovery.

      Which teacher would you prefer, and why?

      The registrar smiles and hands you your class schedule.
      'You're assigned to Professor Aldwin's class.' Wait... that's not who you chose!
      Before you can protest, the registrar shakes your hand. Their palm is ice cold.
      You feel a strange tingling sensation spreading up your arm...
